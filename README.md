# AVR-Embedded-Counter
Level 1 Embedded Systems project: C code for counter, LEDs, and motor control on AVR microcontroller.

This repository contains the source code developed during the Edges Level 1 Embedded Systems training, demonstrating proficiency in **register-level C programming** and **direct hardware interfacing** with AVR microcontrollers.

The projects showcase core skills critical to resource-constrained environments, including low-latency control and robust I/O management.

### Core Technical Skills Demonstrated

C Programming: Focused on efficient, low-level code and memory manipulation.
Microcontroller Interfacing: Direct control of AVR General Purpose Input/Output (GPIO) ports and peripheral registers.
System Timing & State Logic: Implementation of deterministic delays and finite state machine principles for sequential processes.
Bitwise Operations: Mastery of bit manipulation for precise register configuration and pin control.

### Key Project Implementations

Advanced Digital Counter:
- Developed a robust counter application implementing increment, decrement, pause, and reset functions controlled via push-button inputs. Logic included state management and error feedback via a buzzer.
AVR GPIO, C Logic, System Timers.

I/O Control Tasks:
- Implemented solutions for sequential and alternating LED patterns and a base platform for Pulse Width Modulation (PWM), establishing a foundation for DC Motor Control and speed regulation.
C, Delay Functions, PWM Fundamentals.
